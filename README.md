Implementing a short matlab script to quickly solve for missing traction-separation variables for cohesive damage. 

Begin by inputting the required variables, in this case your maximum separation, damage separation, and maximum traction.

The Kn is calculated as the slope from the origin to the apex point. The fracture energy is the triangle area.
